"""These are 'eager' versions of some of the iterator-based
functions. The original versions are 'lazy', meaning that they only
produce results as needed. This is often good, but sometimes you
really just want the algorithm to eagerly evaluate the results without
being prodded. That's what these functions are for.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Since these functions are eager, they will immediately
iterate over all inputs rather than waiting. This means that, if any
of your inputs are infinite or just very large, these functions will
never return and/or consume a lot of system resources. You have been
warned.
